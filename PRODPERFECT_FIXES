==========
* Upgraded this repo (our fork of devexpress/testcafe) to match the upstream tag: v1.10.2-alpha.3.  The name of the local branch with this upgraded version is `p2-1.10.2-alpha.3`.
* Upgraded our fork of hammerhead (prodperfect/testcafe-hammerhead) from 17.1.20 -> 19.2.3. NOTE: at the time of writing, the 1.10.2-alpha.3 testcafe upstream version of package.json had hammerhead 19.2.2 listed as the dependency (not 19.2.3). I modified our forked version of package.json to use 19.2.3 to match our forked version of hammerhead.  This may or may not introduce issues. I'm hoping since it's a minor increment things will be ok.

==========
* Upgraded testcafe repo to `1.9.4`
* Modified package.json to point testcafe-hammerhead to `"git://github.com/ProdPerfect/testcafe-hammerhead.git#p2-17.1.20"`.  `p2-17.1.20` is the ProdPerfect fork of hammerhead and corresponds to version `17.1.20` of upstream, but includes local fixes.
